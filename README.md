# Toggle All Deformers and Effectors C4D plugins

What these two little plugins do? Well, they speed up your workflow.

  Toggle All Deformers:
      It's simply disable and enable all the deformers you have in your scene with just one click.
      It allows you speed up the overall speed in your viewport whenever and whatever you animate.
      You don't have to do it diving into your Objects Hierarchy by doing it manually. It's quick and cool.
      
  Toggle All Effectors:
      It's exactly the same as the Toggle All Deformers plugin. The only difference, as you probably have already guessed,
      it enables and disables all the effectors you have in your scene.
      
Installation:
1. Download.
2. Unzip them to your C4D plugins folder
3. Enjoy

palette via "Customize Commands... (Shift+F12)"
